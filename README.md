# üìù Introduction - WiDS Datathon 2024 Challenge #2 
## Equity in Healthcare
*Women in Data Science (WiDS)* Worldwide is on a mission to increase participation of women in data science to benefit societies worldwide.

**Healthcare inequity** is a global challenge. Addressing this challenge has an extensive positive impact on women‚Äôs health, which is key for societies and economies to thrive. This datathon is designed to help you discover whether disparate treatments exist and to understand the drivers of those biases, such as demographic and societal factors.

In the first datathon challenge was possible to explore the relationship between socio economic aspects that contribute to health equity. For this next challenge we‚Äôre building on that analysis to see how climate patterns impact access to healthcare.

- Task <br>
Predict the duration of time it takes for patients to receive metastatic cancer diagnosis, based on patient characteristics, zip demographics and climate data (average temperatures).

- Why is it important? <br>
Metastatic TNBC is considered the most aggressive TNBC and requires urgent and timely treatment. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and subsequent treatment can have devastating effects in these difficult cancers. Differences in the wait time to get treatment is a good proxy for disparities in healthcare access.

- Data <br>
A real-world evidence dataset from Health Verity (HV), one of the largest healthcare data ecosystems in the US, as the main data source for the Datathon.
In particular, the HV dataset that we use for this challenge contains health related information of patients who were diagnosed with metastatic triple negative breast cancers in the US.
The dataset was then further enriched with zip code level climate data, to explore the relations between health outcomes and climate patterns.
